    "Traffic  accidents  cause  serious  threat to  the  human life worldwide, the economy and reduces efficiency in transportation. Some factors that  contribute to the risk of collisions are; vehicle design, speed of operation, road design, road environment, weather conditions, lighting conditions, driving skills, impairment due to alcohol or drugs, and behavior, notably distracted driving, speeding, and street racing.\n",
